# VideoVault

Local-first short-video research, downloader, library, storage, and lightweight processing app.

This repository is intended to be built phase-by-phase with Codex.

`START_HERE.md`

Codex workflow:
`CODEX_SETUP.md`

Project agent rules:
`AGENTS.md`

Phase plans:

Phase prompts:
`prompts/`

## Important

Only download/store media you are authorized to use.
This project must not implement DRM/access-control/private-content bypasses.

## Local development

Requirements: Python 3.12+, Node 22.12+ (Node 24 LTS recommended), npm, and Git.
FFmpeg/ffprobe are needed in later media phases. Docker is not required.
Run the following PowerShell commands from the repository root.

### First-time setup

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e './backend[dev]'
Set-Location frontend
npm ci
Set-Location ..
```

Copy `.env.example` only if you do not already have a `.env` file. Do not commit
local configuration or credentials. Virtual environment activation is optional;
these commands use its Python executable directly to avoid PowerShell policy issues.

### Start the backend

In the first terminal, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.main
```

The default API is http://127.0.0.1:8000. Health is available at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health and returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
Interactive API docs are at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
`APP_HOST`, `APP_PORT`, and `APP_ENV` load from the root `.env` regardless of
the working directory; process environment variables take precedence.
Development mode enables automatic reload.

### Start the frontend

In a second terminal, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. The shell checks backend connectivity and offers a
retry button. Vite proxies `/api` to `APP_HOST`/`APP_PORT` from the root `.env`,
defaulting to `127.0.0.1:8000`. Restart Vite after configuration changes.
The development proxy avoids the need for cross-origin browser permissions.
Health requests time out after five seconds.

### Verification

Backend, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff format --check .
```

Frontend, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location frontend
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Frontend dependencies are locked in `frontend/package-lock.json`; use `npm ci`
for repeat installs. Python dependency bounds live in `backend/pyproject.toml`.
The production build is a compilation check; production API serving/routing
will be designed in the release phase. `npm run preview` has no API proxy.

Existing `data/downloads`, `data/temp`, and `data/thumbnails` directories remain
empty foundations. Phase 00 contains no database or media features.
Phase 01 adds validated settings, restricted CORS, centralized logging, and a
stable API error envelope. The next planned phase is **Phase 02 — Database & Migrations**.

### Backend foundation configuration

All settings load from the root `.env`, with process environment variables taking
precedence. Invalid settings fail during application creation; diagnostic text
does not include submitted configuration values. `create_app(settings)` accepts
explicit validated settings, and `app.api.dependencies.get_settings` supports
normal FastAPI dependency overrides without a global settings cache.

| Variable | Default | Validation/behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | `development`, `test`, or `production` |
| `APP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | IP address or hostname |
| `APP_PORT` | `8000` | 1–65535 |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./data/videovault.db` | SQLite URL with a path; unused until Phase 02 |
| `LOCAL_STORAGE_ROOT` | `./data/downloads` | Nonempty path |
| `TEMP_STORAGE_ROOT` | `./data/temp` | Nonempty path |
| `THUMBNAIL_STORAGE_ROOT` | `./data/thumbnails` | Nonempty path |
| `DOWNLOAD_MAX_HEIGHT` | `1080` | 1–1080; reserved for downloader phases |
| `DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Positive integer; reserved for queue phases |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | `http://127.0.0.1:5173` | One HTTP(S) origin, no credentials/path/query/fragment |

Relative storage paths resolve against the repository root; absolute paths remain
absolute. Settings do not create directories or open a database. `STORAGE_PROVIDER`
and Google Drive placeholders in `.env.example` remain unused.

Application log level is DEBUG in development and INFO in test/production, using
timestamp, level, module, and message. Unexpected errors log their exception class
and stack locations without exception text, request content, or local variables.
Public errors are defined in the API contract. CORS allows only `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`
and does not enable credentials. Its protocol-level rejected preflight response
is the standard middleware response rather than an application error envelope.

`app/db/session.py` reserves the database dependency and raises `NotImplementedError`
if called. No production route calls it; SQLAlchemy and Alembic are Phase 02 work.
