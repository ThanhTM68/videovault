# VideoVault

Local-first short-video research, downloader, library, storage, and lightweight processing app.

This repository is intended to be built phase-by-phase with Codex.

Start with:
`START_HERE.md`

Codex workflow:
`CODEX_SETUP.md`

Project agent rules:
`AGENTS.md`

Phase plans:
`docs/exec-plans/`

Phase prompts:
`prompts/`

## Important

Only download/store media you are authorized to use.
This project must not implement DRM/access-control/private-content bypasses.

## Local development (Phase 00)

Requirements: Python 3.12+, Node 22.12+ (Node 24 LTS recommended), npm, and Git.
FFmpeg/ffprobe are needed in later media phases. Docker is not required.
Run the following PowerShell commands from the repository root.

### First-time setup

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e './backend[dev]'
Set-Location frontend
npm ci
Set-Location ..
```

Copy `.env.example` only if you do not already have a `.env` file. Do not commit
local configuration or credentials. Virtual environment activation is optional;
these commands use its Python executable directly to avoid PowerShell policy issues.

### Start the backend

In the first terminal, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.main
```

The default API is http://127.0.0.1:8000. Health is available at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health and returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
Interactive API docs are at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
`APP_HOST`, `APP_PORT`, and `APP_ENV` load from the root `.env` regardless of
the working directory; process environment variables take precedence.
Development mode enables automatic reload.

### Start the frontend

In a second terminal, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. The shell checks backend connectivity and offers a
retry button. Vite proxies `/api` to `APP_HOST`/`APP_PORT` from the root `.env`,
defaulting to `127.0.0.1:8000`. Restart Vite after configuration changes.
The development proxy avoids the need for cross-origin browser permissions.
Health requests time out after five seconds.

### Verification

Backend, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff format --check .
```

Frontend, from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location frontend
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Frontend dependencies are locked in `frontend/package-lock.json`; use `npm ci`
for repeat installs. Python dependency bounds live in `backend/pyproject.toml`.
The production build is a compilation check; production API serving/routing
will be designed in the release phase. `npm run preview` has no API proxy.

Existing `data/downloads`, `data/temp`, and `data/thumbnails` directories remain
empty foundations. Phase 00 contains no database or media features.
The next planned phase is **Phase 01 — Backend Foundation**.
